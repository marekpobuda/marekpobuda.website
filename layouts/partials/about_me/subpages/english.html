  I studied opera singing at the Church Conservatory in Bratislava with prof. Vlasta Hudecová and subsequently at the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava with prof. Dagmar Podkamenská-Bezačinská. During studying opera performance at the Academy I debuted in Mozart´s operas The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute as Figaro, Don Giovanni and Papageno, and I performed many other opera characters. I am focused on songs interpretation, opera, as well as operatic pop. As sa host soloist I work in various Operas  in Slovakia and abroad, e.g. in the Slovak National Theatre I portray Acmet in King Teodor in Venice, the project of an opera studio Giovanni Paisiello; Paris in Romeo and Juliet, an opera performance by Charles Gounod. I host also in State Opera Banská Bystrica where I portray Miller in the child´s opera Puss in Boots, and as a Bandure boss in Jánošík by Cikker. The Janáček Theatre (Opera) in Brno  offers a lovely children´s performance Beauty Land, in which I portray the role of Papouš, that is focused mainly on opera genre interpretation. I reguraly attend opera singing competitions (2nd prize at The 16th Imrich Godin International Vocal Competition in Vráble).
